[Recovery]
The system lets deadlocks occur and detects them.
This might be good solution when it is much less costly to detect a deadlock and deal with it than to do matrix stuff all the time.

[Prevention]
We can prevent deadlocks by getting rid of any of the following:
- Mutual Exclusion
- Hold and Wait
- No preemption
- Circular wait

The easiest is to forcibly preempt the resources and give them to another high-priority process.

[Avoidance]
Deadlock can be avoided with Bankerâ€™s Algorithm.
This is pretty useful in theory, but can be kind of expensive in practice
