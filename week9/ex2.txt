The easiest way to decrease the hit/miss ratio is by using thrashing.
Example:
    Frames = 3
    Seq: 1234 1234 ...
         ^^^
            ^
              ^
               ^
                ^
                 ^
                    ... (will miss every time)


One of the ways of increasing this ratio is by using the inverse of thrashing
NB: this sequence makes algorithms' execution very close to the optimal
Example:
    Frames = 3
    Seq: 1234 4321 1234 4321 ...
         ^^^
            ^
                 ^
                      ^
                           ^
                             ... (just 1 miss for 3 hits)
